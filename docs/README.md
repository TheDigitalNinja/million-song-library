## Viewing AsciiDoc Documentation

The Million Song Library project documentation is written using [AsciiDoc](http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/), a plain-text markup format for authoring documentation. The documentation was rendered to HTML and PDF formats using the [Asciidoctor](http://asciidoctor.org/) and [Asciidoctor-pdf processors](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-pdf).

Alternately, you can use the [Asciidoctor.js Live Preview](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/asciidoctorjs-live-previe/iaalpfgpbocpdfblpnhhgllgbdbchmia) extension for Chrome to view AsciiDoc (.adoc) files without rendering them.

1. In Chrome, install the [Asciidoctor.js Live Preview](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/asciidoctorjs-live-previe/iaalpfgpbocpdfblpnhhgllgbdbchmia) extension.

2. Navigate to the **chrome://extensions/** page (or select **Menu > More Tools > Extensions**).

3. Under the **Asciidoctor.js Live Preview** extension, select the **Allow access to file URLs** checkbox.

4. To view a local AsciiDoc (.adoc) file, open it in Chrome, or drag the file into the Chrome window.
